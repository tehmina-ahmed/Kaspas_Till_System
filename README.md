# Kaspas Self-Service Till System - SFIA 1 

Project Contributor: Tehmina Ahmed

## Abstract
The KaspasTill App was planned, designed and has been documented in this ReadMe.MD to show the process of the project. Agile Methodology was used throughout the project to ensure efficiency where possible. It's a Responsive till system App using CRUD functionality. Allowing users to Create an item, View the item, update it and delete it if need be. 
Kaspas LTD is an ice cream parlour that provides the user with the ability to create a dessert of choice and enter it into the MySQL database. The option for the user is to be able to Create a Dessert and a Topping (as their product of choice), to view it, update it and/ delete it based on their liking of the product. The idea behind this App is to give the user control of their products - essentially replicating the purpose of a self service till. This idea stems from a theory of customer journey where it is beleived that in modern times, the customer should be given more control of their product journey in order to ensure higher rates of satisfaction. This theory has been applied to the Till app to assess this hypothesis.
